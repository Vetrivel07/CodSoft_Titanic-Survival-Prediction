## Internship Project at Codsoft

I completed an internship at Codsoft, where I worked on various tasks and projects to enhance my skills and knowledge. This repository contains the details of the tasks I completed during my internship.

## Task and Project:

### Task 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
- Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
- The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
- Dataset - Kaggle

## About the Internship:

My internship at Codsoft was a valuable learning experience that helped me develop my skills in data science, Python programming, and collaborative project development. I worked on various tasks and projects, collaborating with the team to deliver high-quality results and gain practical experience in the field.
